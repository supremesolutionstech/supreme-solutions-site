                <h2>About Supreme Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    Supreme Solutions was founded by two cybersecurity professionals with one mission — to make high-quality IT management and security accessible to every business, not just large corporations. We believe every small business deserves enterprise-level protection, automation, and peace of mind.
                </p>

                <h3>style="text-align: center; Our Story</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea for Supreme Solutions began when co-founder <strong>Malik Browne</strong>, an Information Technology graduate and <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong> certified professional, worked on healthcare technology implementations in partnership with Cone Health. Malik saw firsthand how many organizations struggled to maintain secure, efficient systems — often without dedicated IT staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Around the same time, co-founder <strong>Anthony Scott</strong> was serving in the <strong>U.S. Navy</strong>, managing cybersecurity operations aboard submarines. His hands-on experience protecting mission-critical systems inspired him to bring military-grade discipline and defense strategies to the business world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Together, they combined their technical expertise and passion for innovation to create Supreme Solutions — a next-generation managed service provider (MSP) powered by AI automation and human expertise.
